I am a PhD student, studying under the supervision of [Pierre-Yves Strub](https://www.strub.nu/) and [Benjamin Werner](http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Benjamin.Werner/).
My interests include the use of formal methods in cryptography, mostly the post-quantum primitives based on LWE and supersingular isogenies.
In particular, I participated in the developpement of the proof assistant [EasyCrypt](https://github.com/EasyCrypt/easycrypt), the certified compiler [Jasmin](https://github.com/jasmin-lang/jasmin/) and the certified implementation [Hakyber](https://github.com/formosa-crypto/hakyber).
